EventPilot is a Discord bot written in Java using the Spring Boot, Project Reactor and Discord4J
library. Its primary functionality is to help users create and manage events, allowing other Discord
members to sign up for these events. Whether you're organizing gaming sessions, study groups, or any
other kind of event, EventPilot simplifies the process by providing a user-friendly interface within
your Discord server.

## About Project

This project began as a personal hobby, driven by my interest in reactive programming and
experimentation with the Project Reactor library. Initially, it was intended for personal use
within my Discord server among friends. However, over time, it evolved into a robust application
with its own database, asynchronous operations, CI pipeline and much more.

### Technologies Used

_The project leverages the following technologies:_

- [**Java 17**](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) - The programming language used
  to develop the bot.
- [**Project Reactor**](https://projectreactor.io) - Library for reactive programming in Java,
  utilized to handle asynchronous operations.
- [**Discord4J**](https://discord4j.com) - Discord API wrapper for Java, enabling seamless
  integration with the Discord platform.
- [**Spring Boot**](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Framework used for building Java
  applications, providing features such as web development, data persistence, and logging.
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org) - An open-source relational database management
  system, used to store and manage event-related data.
- [**Flyway**](https://flywaydb.org) - Database migration tool that ensures the consistency and
  integrity of the database schema.
- [**Redis**](https://redis.io) - In-memory data store used as a database and cache for efficient
  data storage and retrieval.
- [**JUnit 5**](https://junit.org/junit5/) - Testing framework for Java, utilized for writing unit
  tests.
- [**Mockito**](https://site.mockito.org) - Mocking framework used for testing, providing
  flexibility in creating and verifying mock objects.
- [**Testcontainers**](https://testcontainers.com) - A Java library that simplifies the use of
  Docker containers for integration testing.
- [**Reactor Test**](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/index.html#testing) -
  Testing module for the Reactor library, facilitating the testing of reactive code.
- [**Buildpacks**](https://buildpacks.io) - Used to build OCI-compliant images for streamlined
  deployment and scalability.

### Lessons Learned

Throughout the development, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience in several areas. This
includes working with the Discord API and Discord4J library, implementing reactive programming using
Project Reactor, managing a PostgreSQL database, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, conducting
comprehensive testing with JUnit 5 and Mockito, leveraging Docker containers for integration testing
using Testcontainers, utilizing buildpacks for building OCI-compliant images, as well as integrating
Spring Data Redis and Redis for handling custom user sessions. This project has provided me with
practical hands-on experience in building a robust Discord bot and honing my skills in various Java
technologies and frameworks, as well as modern deployment practices.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get EventPilot up and running in your Discord server.

### Prerequisites

If you intend to only run bot on your local machine, you need:

- Docker

Before you begin to code, make sure your development environment have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Maven
- Docker

### Run application locally in docker

One of the approach to run bot locally is that we can use docker container to run both application
and database with ease. Preferable approach is to run docker-compose.yml file, to make sure all the
configuration is set
correctly. Example of working
[docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/havlli/EventPilot/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
from this repository.

```yaml
name: eventpilot
services:
  eventpilot:
    container_name: eventpilot-app
    image: eventpilot:latest
    environment:
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://database:5432/eventpilot
      CACHE_REDIS_HOST: cache
      DISCORD_TOKEN: your-discord-bot-token
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
      - database
      - cache
  database:
    container_name: eventpilot-postgres
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: eventpilot
      POSTGRES_USER: havlli
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - database:/data/postgres
    ports:
      - 5554:5432
    restart: unless-stopped
  cache:
    container_name: eventpilot-redis
    image: redis:7-alpine
    hostname: cache
    ports:
      - 6378:6379
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  database:
```

1. Create or download docker-compose.yml file with same structure presented above.

Make sure you replace `DISCORD_TOKEN` environmental variable with your discord bot token. If you're
unsure how to obtain the discord bot token
check [FAQ: How to acquire Discord Bot Token](#how-to-acquire-discord-bot-token)

2. Once you set your `DISCORD_TOKEN` variable simply run in same directory:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

3. Done! After docker successfully creates and runs both containers your bot should appear online in
   your server and listening to commands.

_Note: If your bot is not present in the server you have to first invite the bot.
[FAQ: How to invite newly created bot to my Discord server](#how-to-invite-newly-created-bot-to-my-discord-server)_

### Setup Development Environment

1. CD to your project folder and clone repository.

```shell
cd projectdirectory
git clone https://github.com/havlli/EventPilot.git
```

2. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the environmental variables, no need to export
   environmental variables into your system since `spring-dotenv` manages importing env variables
   from `.env` file.

```dotenv
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
TEST_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_FOR_TESTING
```

_Note: You can use same token for the test token, you should be running the development environment
on testing discord bot instance. In case you're running dev environment on "live" discord server you
can use different
token for testing Discord4J and Discord API calls._

3. In terminal navigate to `docker-compose-services.yml` and compose postgresql container in detach
   mode.

```shell
cd src/main/resources
docker compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up -d
```

_Note: If you make any changes to postgres container make sure the changes reflects in application
properties `application.yml` as well._

4. Done! You're up and ready to start coding!

## FAQ

### How to acquire Discord Bot Token

1. Navigate to **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)** and login.
2. Click on **'New Application'** to create a new application.
3. Give your application a name and click **'Create'**.
4. In the left sidebar, click on **'Bot'**.
5. Under the **Token** section, click on **'Reset Token'** and then **'Copy'** to copy the bot token
   to your clipboard.

_Note: Treat your bot token as a secret and keep it secure. Do not share it publicly or commit it to
version control. You can keep your token in .env file. Application loads environmental variables
from that file._

### How to invite newly created bot to my Discord server

To invite your created bot to your Discord server, you'll need the **"Manage Server"** permission or
have an account with the necessary permissions on the Discord server where you want to add the bot.

1. Navigate to **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)** and login.
2. Select your bot application.
2. In the left sidebar, click on **'OAuth2'**, then click on **'URL Generator'**.
3. Under **Scopes** make sure that **'bot'** and **'applications.commands'** values are checked.
4. Under **Bot Permissions** make sure that **'Administrator'** value is checked.
5. Copy the generated URL and open it in your web browser.
6. You will be prompted to authorize the bot. Select the Discord server where you want to add the
   bot and authorize it.
7. Complete any additional verification steps if prompted.
8. The bot will now be added to your Discord server.
